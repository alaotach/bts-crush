## 🎨 Art Assets (MUCH SIMPLER NOW! ✨)

### ✅ Required - Just Base Sprites:

### ❌ NO LONGER NEEDED:
- ~~28 special candy sprite variants~~ ✨ Auto-generated!
  - ~~Striped sprites~~ → Procedurally generated!

**Assets Needed:** 7-8 sprites instead of 35! 🎉

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Match 4 horizontal creates StripedVertical
- [ ] Match 4 vertical creates StripedHorizontal
- [ ] T-shape creates Balloon
- [ ] L-shape creates Balloon
- [ ] Match 5+ creates Rainbow
- [ ] Striped candies clear rows/columns correctly
- [ ] Balloon clears 3×3 area
- [ ] Rainbow clears all of one color

### Combo Testing
- [ ] Striped + Striped = Cross explosion

- [ ] Rainbow + Balloon = Transform & pop
- [ ] Rainbow + Rainbow = Clear entire board

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Special candies work near board edges

## 📊 Progress Summary

**Code:** 100% Complete ✅  
**Art Assets:** ~90% Complete (just need base sprites - probably already have!) ✨  
**Configuration:** 100% Auto-configured ✅  
**Testing:** Ready to test!  
**Polish:** Visual effects auto-generated!

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **You probably already have base sprites!** Check your Assets/Sprites folder
2. 🎮 **Play the game** - special candies will auto-generate visuals
3. 🎨 **Optional**: Create a nice balloon sprite for better quality
4. ⚙️ **Optional**: Tweak visual settings (stripe color, thickness, etc.)
5. 🎉 **Done!** That's literally it!

## 💡 Quick Start

If you want to test the system RIGHT NOW without finished art:

1. Use placeholder colored squares for special candies
2. Add simple stripe overlays in Unity (UI Image component)
3. Test the logic and gameplay
4. Replace with proper art later

This lets you verify everything works before investing time in art!
